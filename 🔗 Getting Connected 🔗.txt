📡 Find Your Headset IPv4 Adress🐝

In your headset, open Settings.

⚙️ Network → Wi-Fi and select your current connected wifi network → Scoll to find IPv4 ⚙️

(Addresses will look something like , 192.168.x.x or 10.0.x.x or even 172.16.x.x).

🕹️ Setup in Patchworld:

PC → Patch	Spawn Execute block and set: port_in 3330. Hit Connect in the bridge app.
Patch → PC	Spawn Execute block and set: port_out 5550. Hit Connect in the bridge app.

🎹 Devices are already made in Patchworld that have these blocks, OSC addresses mapped already so check out Beesplease's/BeeTeam's Worlds)

💎 Pro Patch Tip: Connect an Onload block to your Execute blocks to automatically set execute blocks which will trigger port(s) and IP when the world loads. 💎

🛠️ Troubleshooting Connectivity:

PC → Patch fails: Manually enter the Headset's IPv4 in the bridge app and reconnect. 

❌ No Luck? Try spawning an Execute block In Patch and set: remote_ip <PC_IPv4_HERE>

If Patch → PC fails: Ensure Execute block in Patch is set to your PC's IPv4 address.
